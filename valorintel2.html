  <p> Former star player Jay Won, commonly known as "sinatraa", has recently been trialed for an American league team. At the time, it is currently unclear rather or not he has any interest in joining. VALORANT Intel has not yet confirmed what team he was trialed for, but it is suspected that it was likely a Tier 1 VCT Americans league team. Sinatraa hasn't competed in pro play since May of 2021 after receiving a 6 month competitive ban due to sexual-assault allegations from his ex-girlfriend. </p>
  
  <p> VALORANT Intel will keep you updated on the situation as we uncover more information. </p>
